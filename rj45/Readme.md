# Laboratory work â„–2. Production of a crossover cable Ethernet


## Analysis of standards and wiring diagrams for Ethernet cable contacts

The TIA/EIA standards define the rules for the use of unshielded twisted pairs (UTP) in local area networks. TIA/EIA 568-A and 568-B are commercial cable standards for local area networks; they are widely used in local area networks of organizations and, among other things, determine the color of each cable for different contacts.

### Use a straight cable to connect:
- Switch with router
- Computer with hub
### Use a cross cable to connect:
- Switch with switch
- Switch with hub
- Hub with hub
- Router with Router
- Computer with computer
- Computer with router
